> Luo et al. (2023), Character 50.

> - This character was formulated by Luo et al. (2023), in which the slender proximal segment of pectoral appendage was defined as ‘length/width ratio greater than 7’. Here, we modified the definition of the slender proximal segment as ‘length/width ratio greater than 4.0 in mature individuals’. This is because this feature (length/width ratio of proximal segment of pectoral appendage) is demonstrably variable based on the individual size of a single species, but in the fully mature one, we consider it as a stable proportion. The proportion of 4.0 is referred from Stensiö (1948, p. 151), who stated that ‘in most species, it is 4-3.3 times as long as broad in fully mature individuals, but in several species, it is of a longer and slenderer shape’. For those species erected based on only young individuals or species that cannot be determined as mature ones, we scored their character state as “?” in the data matrix.
